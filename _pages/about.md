I'm a Masters student at NYU with a focus on Deep Learning.  
I interned at [Imagen](https://imagen.ai) during Summer 2018 with [Christian Ledig](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oKhGz8UAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Sumit Chopra](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ETU-ePAAAAAJ&hl=en).  
Previously, I've worked as a Software Developer at [Zomato](https://www.zomato.com) and owned an ecommerce/logistics startup.
