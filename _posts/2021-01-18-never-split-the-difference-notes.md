Recently I read the book "Never Split the Difference", a book on "hostage negotiation" by former CBI terrorist negotiator Chris Voss, but lessons that can be applied to just about any converation in life to: 

* connect,
* understand each other,
* build a better relation,
* empathize,
* resolve difference, and,
* to reach a goal and get what you want.


After reading the book, I applied a few tricks off-hand and surpringly got a positive feeback. I'm logging some of the core lessons so that I can not only visit these from time to time, but also serve as a quick "refresher" whenever I'm about to have an important conversation.

The lessons here are listed in the order they might be used as the conversaion progresses:

### 1. Active Listening
Everyone wants their story to be heard. Focus and listen to it carefully to apply the following:

#### a. Tactical Empathy
Understanding the feelign and midset of another in the moment and also hearing what is *behind* those feelings so you increase your infelunce in all the moments that follow. It's bringing your attentiont to both the emotion obstacle and potention pathways to getting an agreement done.

#### b. Labeling
Communicate back what they're trying to say with phrases like:

* *"It seems like..."*
* *"It looks like..."*

This concretizes

1. The core disagreement
2. The counterpart's hesitation in agreeing with you

Remember to diffuse the negatives, and reinforce the positives.

#### c. Pause
Dramatic pause after labeling to give them a moment to let it sink in.

#### c. Body Language
Throughtout the conversation, use the following:

* calm and deep boice
* conscious smile and confidence
* mirror their words

### 2. Get them to say "No"
To engage them more and open up their reasoning, get them to say No to an extreme & fake summary of their end-goal.

### 3. Get them to say "That's right"
Your paraphrasing+labeling (=summary) should level down the field, bring up and **clarify any assumptions** both parties were holding.

### 4. Perspectives: bend their reality

* Deadlines are not real
* Drop the *"fair"*  word: "Do you think this is fair?". This will get them to say "No" and open up their reasoning
* Define an extreme anchor by low-balling something, like a price or a proposition. Diffuse the situation (*"this may be too much to ask..."*)
* Add extra gifts/favors, discuss and materialize common interests
* If there's a demand, that number should be something very specific
* Mention your name: humanize the situation


### 5. Calibrated Questions (very important)
*"He who has learned to disagree without bring disagreeable has discovered the most valuable secret of negotiation."* 

Questions like "How am I supposed to do that?" are open-ended with the aim to open up their reasoning, while giving them the illusion of control.

Asking these *how* questions will make them concretize their reasoning, explicitly state their assumptions and bring out the gaps, if any.

A few more examples:

* *"What are we trying to accomplish?"*
* *"How is that worthwile?"*
* *"What's the core issue here?"*
* *"How does that affect things?"*


**Prepare in advance.**
