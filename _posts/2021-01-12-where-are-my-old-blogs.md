`12:10am`: I'm finally resurrecting my personal presence on the internet. This time I'm going a step further than just having a html page with my courses and projects listed down, which closely imitated those snobbish webpages from the academia which clearly shouted out "I don't give a fuck about CSS". But I've been a web developer, so I have no excuse and should at least have a minimal website with the standard Jekyll and GH setup. So here we are.

Since my each new attempt to blog is heavily driven by my temptation to try a new platform, all my previous blogs, from 2010 (gawd I'm old) are dispered all over the place.

I finally managed to go down the memory lane and list them all here:
